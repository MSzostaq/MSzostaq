I am Maciej, a frontend developer based in Krakow ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± working [@ReasonApps](https://www.reasonapps.pl/). I mainly work on ecommerce and marketing projects. I am skilled in TypeScript, ReactJS, NextJS, GraphQL and consuming REST APIs. I pay particular attention to good UX/UI in projects because I believe it is crucial for the success of any application.
